<h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가</h2>

<p>JavaScript (), [6] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
  interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic,
weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of
the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. [7] JavaScript enables interactive web pages
and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, [8] and
all major web browers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
